0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

It's the longest word in Englihh dictionary.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

It measures resource usage.

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

There are 16 variables.

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

We do it to save time and memory.

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

We read text one character at a time - if the character is a letter or an apostrophe (that does not begin a word), we add it to the word we currently build.
If while reading characters we encounter a digit, we skip this word. If the character we reached is neither a letter (or apostrophe) nor a digit, and judging by the index variable
we can assume that we already built a word of some length, we finish building the current word and start building the next one.

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

fscanf separates words by a whitespace, but our text file also includes punctuation marks, which fscanf will treat as part of words.
Besides, with fscanf there is no easy protection against extremely long words, that could cause problems if read.

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

We did this to prevent accidental changes to these parameters.
